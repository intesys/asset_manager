 *   |--my_plugin.css.sass
 *   |--my_complex_plugin/
 *   |  |--fonts.css.sass

 * We try to be very careful about what we put in this folder in order not to

 *   base/
 *   |--fonts.css.sass
 *   |--colors.css.sass

/* This folder is made up of independent modules and submodules. Examples for
 * modules could be things like: search-box, dialog, navigation, menu,
 * content-box. While submodules are more specific versions of these modules
 * such as: dialog-wide, navigation-tabbed, menu-dropdown.
 *
 * The ideal module is completely independent of its context and should work
 * within any layout container or other module. If a specific context requires
 * changes to a module you rather create a submodule that describes the
 * context, instead changing styles based on the parent (e.g.
 * .content-box-narrow instead of #sidebar .content-box).

 * Structure example:
 *   modules/
 *   |--search-box.css.sass

 * In order to avoid duplication and to uniform presentation we try to define
 * as much as possible of our resources' styling in the "resource" classes.

 * Structure example:
 *   resources/
 *   |--resource/
 *   |  |--resource.css.sass
 *   |  |--excerpt_resource.css.sass
