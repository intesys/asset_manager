= Asset Manager

Asset Manager is a Ruby on Rails gem that allows you to:
- Manage all your assets (images, pdf, zip, ecc.) in a central repository
- Quickly connect instances of your models with this repository, through a nice graphical interface
- Generate markup for your assets in your views with a series of helper methods
To give you a practical example, you can upload an image through the Asset Manager and then associate it to a product and a news article without having to upload it twice. You just make your selection from the central repository.
Asset Manager is generally included in an administration interface where the user manages all her assets and associates them with various application specific model instances. Then, on the frontend side, to present these assets to the end-user.

Please note: Asset Manager doesn't have anything to do with Rails' asset pipeline!

== Installation
Add it to your Gemfile:
  gem 'intesys_asset_manager'

Install the migrations:
  rake asset_manager:install:migrations
  rake db:migrate

== Usage
Since Asset Manager is a Rails engine you need to mount it in your application. In <b>config/routes.rb</b> add this:
  mount AssetManager::Engine => '/asset_manager'

Once mounted you can access the administration interface by visiting <b>http://localhost:3000/asset_manager</b> in a browser.

{http://s6.postimg.org/bwl4w3z4x/archive.png}[http://s6.postimg.org/bwl4w3z4x/archive.png]

From here you can manage all your application's assets: jpg, png, pdf, zip, etc.
For the images that you upload a series of (customizable) versions will be created automatically.

Next you need to specify which of your models will be connected to the Asset Manager.
If, for example, we have a <b>Product</b> that has a <b>main image</b> and a series of <b>pictures</b> and <b>downloads</b> we add the following to our Product model:

  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_image :main_image
    has_images :pictures, max: 10
    has_files :downloads
  end

You have two methods to choose from: <b>has_file</b> when the association is singular and <b>has_files</b> when multiple files need to be associated. These methods accept a series of parameters to specify which file types are accepted, how many files can be associated (for has_files), etc.

Once you have your models configured you can connect assets with your records. Asset Manager provides {Formtastic}[https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic] and {SimpleForm}[https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form] input types to make it easier to manage your forms:
  = semantic_form_for @product do |f|
    = f.inputs do
      = f.input :title
      = f.input :description
    = f.inputs
      = f.input :main_image, as: :asset_manager
      = f.input :pictures, as: :asset_manager
      = f.input :downloads, as: :asset_manager

The Asset Manager will be opened in a <b>modal window</b> so your application needs to provide one. For example, if you're using <b>Fancybox</b> you need to add the following to your <b>application.js</b>:
  #= require fancybox2
  $ ->
    $(".asset_manager_iframe").fancybox
      type: 'iframe'
      width: '100%'
      height: '100%'
      autoSize: false
      helpers:
        title:
          type: 'outside'

Then you will have something similar to:

{http://s6.postimg.org/rw3sfnv6p/demo.gif}[http://s6.postimg.org/rw3sfnv6p/demo.gif]

Remeber to use the <b>am_permit_fields</b> method to update the list of permitted parameters. For instance:
  class ProductsController < ApplicationController

    # crud methods
    ...

    private

    def product_params
      params.require(:product).permit([:title, :description] + Product.am_permit_fields)
    end
  end

Now that we have associated assets with our records we can use one of the view helpers provided by Asset Manager to present them to the end-user:
  = am_render(@product, :main_image)
  = am_render(@product, :pictures)
  = am_render(@product, :downloads)

== Options

Asset Manager can be configured through an initializer <b>config/initializers/asset_manager.rb</b>
  AssetManager.configure do |config|
    ...
  end

=== Private/Public Assets
By default all your assets will be public. It's also possible to have private assets or a mix of both.
  config.asset_types = [:public, :private]

=== Categories and Tags
By default all your assets can be categorized and tagged to keep things organized. You can disable this option.
  config.with_categories = false
  config.with_tags = false

=== Image processing
Asset Manager relies on ImageMagick to process images (for thumbnails etc.). To specify how the processing is done and which formats are created you can redefine <b>custom_versions</b>:
  module AssetManager
    module CustomVersions

      # For a list of possible options, take a look at:
      # http://carrierwave.rubyforge.org/rdoc/classes/CarrierWave/RMagick.html
      def custom_versions
        version :thumb, :if => :image? do
          process :resize_and_pad => [50, 50]
        end
      end

    end
  end

There is also a rake task to re-process already existing images when you add a new format:
  rake asset_manager:recreate_versions

=== Default Image Formats
A list of file formats that will be accepted for has_image and has_images.
  config.default_image_formats = %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
